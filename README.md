# Matrix-Multiplication-Calculator
My version of implementation of 2 algorithms used to compute the product of 2 Matrices:
1. Binet's Algorithm (most commonly taught in Linear Algebra) - **Complexity is O(n^3)**. 
<br>Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication
<br>Implemented to demo knowlege of **classes, inheretance, multi-threading, jUnit**

2. Strassen's Algorithm - **Complexity is O(n^2.8)**
<br>Wiki:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm
<br>Implemented to demo knowlege of **recursion**
